# Gender Healthcare Service Management System

A modern web-based healthcare platform designed to support both patients and clinic administrators. The system includes:

* A **Product Website** for users to access health services, track their menstrual cycles, and communicate with virtual assistants.
* A **Management Website** for clinic staff (doctors, admins) to manage appointments, patient records, and service analytics.
* A **Supabase-powered backend** providing authentication, database management, API, and edge functions.
