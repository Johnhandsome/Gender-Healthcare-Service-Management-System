// Bundle Optimization Configuration for Lazy Loading
// This file provides guidance for optimizing bundle sizes

export const LazyLoadingOptimizationGuide = {
  // 1. Route-based Code Splitting
  routeBasedSplitting: {
    description: "Split code by major routes to reduce initial bundle size",
    implementation: "Each portal (admin, doctor, receptionist) loads as separate chunks",
    benefits: [
      "Smaller initial bundle",
      "Faster page load times",
      "Better caching strategies"
    ]
  },

  // 2. Component-level Splitting
  componentSplitting: {
    description: "Split heavy components into separate chunks",
    targets: [
      "Dashboard components (analytics, charts)",
      "Data tables with large datasets",
      "Form components with complex validation",
      "File upload components"
    ],
    implementation: "Use dynamic imports in component templates"
  },

  // 3. Vendor Bundle Optimization
  vendorOptimization: {
    description: "Optimize third-party library loading",
    strategies: [
      "Split vendor libraries by usage patterns",
      "Load UI libraries only when needed",
      "Use tree-shaking for unused code elimination"
    ]
  },

  // 4. Preloading Strategies
  preloadingStrategies: {
    selective: "Load only critical routes immediately",
    priority: [
      "Dashboard components (high priority)",
      "Navigation components (high priority)", 
      "Settings/profile (medium priority)",
      "Reports/analytics (low priority)"
    ]
  },

  // 5. Performance Metrics to Monitor
  performanceMetrics: {
    initialBundleSize: "Target: < 300KB",
    routeLoadTime: "Target: < 500ms",
    cacheHitRate: "Target: > 80%",
    timeToInteractive: "Target: < 2s"
  },

  // 6. Angular-specific Optimizations
  angularOptimizations: {
    onPush: "Use OnPush change detection strategy",
    trackBy: "Implement trackBy functions for ngFor",
    asyncPipe: "Use async pipe for observables",
    lazyImages: "Implement lazy loading for images",
    serviceWorkers: "Add service worker for caching"
  }
};

// Webpack Configuration Recommendations
export const webpackOptimizations = {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
